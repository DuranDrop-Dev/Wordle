# Wordle

This is an interpretation of the popular word game Wordle, written in REACT. Square turns green if the guessed letter is in the right position. The boxes that have a letter within the wordle but is in the wrong position should turn yellow upon submission but the logic has not been coded yet.

Live version of the web app can be found here: <a href="https://wordle.durandrop.com">wordle.durandrop.com</a>
